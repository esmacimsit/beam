# beam
A minimal domain-specific language (DSL) for structuring AI/ML development workflows.

This project explores how a small, opinionated DSL can reduce cognitive overhead
when building and iterating on AI systems.

The goal is not to replace existing frameworks, but to experiment with:
- clearer intent expression
- reproducible pipelines
- fewer implicit decisions

beam is a research and experimentation project.
The design is intentionally simple and may evolve.
